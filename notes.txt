facial_req.py Notes

In the context of facial recognition in Python, encodingsP = "encodings.pickle" 
implies that face encodings are stored in a file named "encodings.pickle". 
Face encodings are numerical representations generated by analyzing unique 
features of faces, such as the distance between eyes or the shape of the nose, 
and are crucial for identifying or verifying faces in images. 
The "encodings.pickle" file, created by train_model.py, 
contains these serialized encodings, which have been saved using Python's 
pickle module for later use. During the recognition phase, a new face is 
encoded and compared to the stored encodings in "encodings.pickle" to identify the 
individual, leveraging the pre-trained model and previously analyzed facial data.
This methodology facilitates efficient and effective facial recognition by 
utilizing pre-processed data to compare and identify new facial inputs.

The Haar Cascade Classifier
The Haar Cascade Classifier is a machine learning 
object detection method used to identify objects in images or video. 
In the context of face detection, it's used to identify faces in images or real-time video streams. 
The classifier is named after Haar wavelets, which are used to extract
features from images.
The Haar Cascade Classifier is loaded from haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml.
It is pre-trained from OpenCV.
